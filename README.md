## Cloud Security Engineer | Blockchain Engineer (Solidity)

Security-focused infrastructure engineer with hands-on experience designing containerized environments and access-controlled systems.

I build secure cloud-native infrastructure and smart contracts with a security-first mindset — focused on production-aligned systems rather than tutorial projects.

Pinned repositories demonstrate real-world infrastructure patterns, security controls, and modern engineering workflows.

---

## Current Engineering Focus

### Cloud Native Security
- Production-style secure Kubernetes deployments (local K3s/kind)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Containerized workloads using Docker
- RBAC and least-privilege access design
- Secrets management and network policies
- Observability and workload isolation

### Blockchain Engineering
- Solidity smart contract development
- Foundry-based testing (unit, fuzz, invariants)
- Smart contract exploit labs (vulnerable → exploit → patch)
- Security-first protocol architecture

---

## Featured Projects

### Secure Kubernetes Deployment (Terraform + Docker)
Production-style secure Kubernetes platform built with Docker and Terraform, implementing hardened configurations and least-privilege access controls.

**Key Engineering Signals**
- Dockerized workloads  
- Kubernetes deployments and services  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Secrets management  
- Network policies  
- Infrastructure as Code provisioning  

→ Repo: Currently under active development
